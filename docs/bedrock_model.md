## How to generate the output

```python
case_id = log_segment
subject = content_subject


transcript_output = ""

for i in range(len(content_transcript)):
    transcript_output += f"<blockquote><h3>Submitted by {content_transcript[i]['submittedBy']}</h3>Content: {content_transcript[i]['content']}</blockquote>\n"

subject_output = f"<h1>Subject: {subject}</h1>"
summerized_ticket_content = f"<div>\n<h3>Case ID: {case_id}</h3>\n{transcript_output}\n</div>"
```
